1) .val is a function hence u should call as .val() and not as .val

2 while using .html() the outer should have single quote and the style tag should havw double quote

6. .css() has no outer brackets like .html()

3. $() the dom should be placed within quotes

4.  unlike python when u write if or else conditions in js
u have 2 put the cond within a brackets

5. in js true and false keywords dont start with caps lie python

6. multiple dom in a $() dont need individual quotes

7. .css uses , as separator and not : 


8.it is not document.ready(function(){}) but it is $(document).ready(function(){})


9.if give any modification to the dom before it is written in the html,it wont apply,
either u have to apply modification after the dom is written or u use the document.ready function
