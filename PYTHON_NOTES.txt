A SELF DENOTES NOTHING BUT A INSTANCE OF THE CLASS

A SELF KEYWORD IS USED IN A CLASS SO THAT A ARGUMENTS PASSED WHILE INITIATION CAN BE LINKED to the initiated objects


a class will define the structure or the logics/operations that will be performed, while a object has the its very values which will be applied on those operations defined in a class


to safely retrieve a python dictionary keys
use 

.get method

person = {"name":"vignesh}

person["gender"] gives error while person.get("gender") returns none

for a split function if no arg is passed , then any numb of space is considered as one delimiter

u can use input() function anywhere in a program just like a variable is used, the code will stop thr for getting the value

eg: print(int(input())*2*5) is valid


reagrding pyodbc ingestion:


cursor.execute("""use Immilytics_IOP;

insert into dbo.QuestionsResponse(BeneficiaryXref,PurposeOfTravel,IntendedDepartureDate,IntendedReturnDate)
values(?,?,?,?) """,('BXREF0012','SUMMA','',None))


ie. - cursor.execute(sql,values)

this is the right way to use pyodbc abd morover only by this way u can insert null values
